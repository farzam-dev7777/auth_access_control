Parental Consent Required

Dear Parent or Guardian,

<%= @user.full_name %> (age <%= @user.age %>) has requested to create an account on our platform and join the organization <%= @organization&.name || "an organization" %>.

IMPORTANT: Since <%= @user.full_name %> is under 13 years old, we require your explicit consent before they can access the platform.

To review and provide consent for your child's account, please visit this secure link:

<%= @consent_url %>

What happens next?
- You'll be taken to a secure page to review the consent details
- You can choose to grant or deny consent
- If granted, <%= @user.full_name %> will be able to access the platform
- If denied, the account will remain inactive

Security Note: This link will expire in 7 days for security reasons. If you need a new link, please contact us.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Thank you,
The <%= @organization&.name || "Platform" %> Team
